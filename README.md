# TellMe-Counter
A Ruby script to get information on block ID usage with Tellme's block ID dump

Usage:
1. Install tellme and run the command `/tellme dump-csv blocks-id-to-registryname`
1. Have the file in a folder in the top level of your minecraft folder. It will then search for the latest block ID csv file generated by tellme.
2. Run the program from within the folder this file is contained in with `ruby ID\ Checker.rb` to get block ID usage information. Mods are sorted in descending order based on their mod ID usage (most IDs used to least IDs used). The program will also display block IDs left and percentage of block IDs used on the bottom of the print.

\* You can feed it a file through stdin if you want to analyze an old file
